# BTC Address Balance Chart Challenge

Create an area or line chart that displays an all-time historic view on btc address balances.

Draw 5 lines in different colors displaying balances

- over $1k
- over $10k
- over $100k
- over $1M
- over $10M

Display a legend that labels each line color.

See "Example Implementation" to get an idea of how the chart should look like.

## Implementation Notes

- Use a charting engine you feel most comfortable with
- Use the static data provided (`data/Coin_Metrics_Network_Data_2023-02-02T14-32.csv`) to build an API method
  (`pages/api/btc-addresses`)
  - Format the CSV and return JSON timeseries for your charting engine
  - Call the API to load the data inside of your react component
- You can style the chart however you like

## Bonus Points

- Add buttons and filter functionality to filter the chart by YTD, 12M, 3M and 1M.
- Improve performance by leveraging server side rendering
